# GridNomads

**GridNomads** is a dynamic .NET MAUI application featuring a 48x27 grid with five colorful, moving cells. Each cell moves randomly every quarter-second and wraps around the edges of the grid when it reaches the boundaries. This project showcases interactive graphics and game logic in .NET MAUI.

## Features
- A 48x27 grid with dynamic updates.
- Five moving cells represented as either red or blue.
- Cells move in random directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) every 250 milliseconds.
- Edge wrapping logic for smooth movement across boundaries.
- Fully dynamic updates to the grid using MAUI's UI rendering.

## AI Experiment
This project is the **first iteration** of an experiment in AI-generated code. Every component of this project—including the `README.md` that you're reading—has been generated by AI.

Each commit in this repository will:
1. Contain changes generated by AI.
2. Include the prompt used for generating the changes as part of the commit message.

This ensures transparency and offers insight into the iterative process of AI-assisted development.
